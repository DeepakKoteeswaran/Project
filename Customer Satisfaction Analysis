This is my project on analysis of Customer support data of a company. This focuses to improve efficiency in capturing "Voice of customers".

𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁:

𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗱: Excel, Microsoft Power BI

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁:

This dataset contains a CSV table with 5000 records.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵:

𝟭. Understanding the Data: Deep diving into the dataset to understand the data properly, the details related to Agents, Complaint resolution status, Topic areas of complaints, call duration and Satisfaction rating of customers.

𝟮. Data Cleaning and Transformation: I have cleaned the data in Power Query Editor using the following steps-

Firstly, replaced the null values/blank values with 0 from Date, Satisfaction Rating column.
Changed datatype of Average talk duration column.
Extracted seconds, minutes and created a new column 'Duration on calls'.
Created Measures and calculated columns based on stakeholder's requirements.

3. 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱:
As the company is trying to improve their customer support, I have created different visuals to gather important insights on rejected and answered calls, Agents, Topics and Resolution status.
Created cards to showcase important figures to track KPI's.
Provided a slicer to filter through Date.

Visuals Used: Pie chart, Donut chart, Stacked bar and column chart, Area chart.

I would really appreciate any suggestions from LinkedIn Family.

Thanks & Best Regards
